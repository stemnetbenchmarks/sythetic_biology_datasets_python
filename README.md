# Introduction/Abstract

### Core parts:

A. A dataset with a parameter for dataset size: With a transparent validation of each data field. 'synthetic_biology_dataset.csv'
- the original raw data fields are validated with scores
- the answers are validated with scores
- the validated answers (not separately calculated) are pulled into the QA document.

B. Q&A: The questions and correct-answers as a document, based on the particular dataset.

Plus:
- make a blank score_sheet.csv:
-- date, question, model, data_shape, time, score, notes


### Testing:

There are several types of tests that can be done in terms of AI performance, the focus here is on the interplay or conversion between structured-tabular data (such as a database) on the one hand and unstructured natural-language (such as a user's inputs and questions) on the other hand.

It should be possible to make user-friendly, low maintenance, verifiable tools to:
A. generate a dataset that is testable, verifiable, and verified, and that is non-private 'testing data' safe to use on various products, and that can be made to a user-specified size of dataset.
B. generate and verify answers to pre-set questions, based on the verified data
C. Evaluate and compare the performance of models in a standardized and well-defined way, comparing apples to apples.  

Here the dataset will be specifically designed for the specific questions to be asked about it (see details below).


### Example Types of Questions (Summary):
1. What ~simple tabular-operations can the AI reliably do when specifically named?

2. What ~simple tabular-operations can the AI correctly interpret from a non-technical question?  

3. fuzzy questions about the material in given slice of data

4. Non-simple field-engineered and grouped questions given only raw data?
examples maybe standard time engineered field questions and relative time (temp-field) questions: in the last X months...y?

5. To the extent that we know, is the 'AI' (a model or a composite of parts) using a single stateless context window, or is it 'function-calling' and 'tool-using'?
Note: Context windows are large, but 2.5

6. Statistical Questions that go beyond ~descriptive statistics

7. Asking for (results of) basic pandas functions:
- shape()
- unique()
- value_counts()
- describe()
- .sum(), .mean/median/mode()

Etc.


### Context:

Many applications of AI/ML can be tested for performance. Sometimes the term 'benchmark' is used, though the meaning of that term varies. Though generative and vector producing deep learning models have become more performative since late 2022 (when the public release of chat-GPT by open-AI popularized 'foundation-models' sometimes called 'LLM's), there has been a significant absence of organized infrastructure investment in the area of meaningful and usable AI model and service testing and training-data tools; namely, there has been a silence (for whatever reasons) from government standards bodies such as NIST, international standards bodies such as ISO, or trade-group standards organization (which may themselves be missing for AI), academic tools have been missing, as have been private industry based tools such as in the past would have been produced by Bell Labs, Xero Park, IBM, or ambiguous publishers such as RAND. (This topic could be gone into in much more detail, but that is not meant to be the focus here.

### Questions it enables: 
"What is the average weight of each animal type?",
"Which animal type is heaviest?"

#### Sample Answers:
QUESTION: "What is the average weight of all animals?"
ANSWER: Approximately 23 kg (average of all animal types' means, with turtles heaviest at 50kg, birds at 30kg, fish at 20kg, dogs at 10kg, cats at 5kg)

QUESTION: "What is the average weight of cats?"
ANSWER: Approximately 5 kg

QUESTION: "Which animal type is heaviest on average?"

### Questions it enables: 
"Is there a relationship between weight and height?", 
"How does height change as weight increases?"
"Is there a correlation between weight and height?"
ANSWER: Yes, there is a strong negative correlation - smaller animals tend to be taller
"What affects the popularity score?"
ANSWER: There is a U-shaped relationship - very tall and very short animals are more popular than medium-height animals

4. number_of_friends (int):
### Testing purpose: Integer field with cyclical/periodic pattern detection
Default pattern: Cosine relationship with age that creates a wave pattern:
Copynumber_of_friends = base_value + amplitude * cos(frequency * age)
Where:

Base values vary by animal type (dogs: 10, cats: 5, birds: 8, fish: 3, turtles: 2)
Animals gain and lose friends in cycles approximately every 7-8 years
Overall range between 1-15 friends

### Questions it enables:

"How many friends do cats have on average?"
"Is there a relationship between age and number of friends?"
"Which animal type has the most friends?"
"Do animals with more friends tend to be more popular?"
"How does the number of friends change as animals get older?"

This creates a non-intuitive pattern that:
Can't be guessed without analyzing the data
Tests detection of cyclical patterns
Provides a genuine integer field for operations
Creates interesting possibilities for multivariate analysis

#### Sample Answers:
QUESTION: "How many animals were born in the first quarter of the year?"
ANSWER: Approximately 2/3 of all animals (those born in January and February)

QUESTION: "Is there a seasonal pattern to births?"
ANSWER: Yes, animals are only born in winter months (December, January, February)

QUESTION: "What's the median birth timestamp and what date does it correspond to?"
ANSWER: [Value will depend on data generation] which corresponds to a date in January or February

5. birth_date (date): Birth date with strong seasonal patterns (only in winter months) (must not be able to guess/cheat)
### Testing purpose: Date-time data handling and pattern detection in time-features not explicitly in the date-time object
### Questions it enables: 
"When do most animals tend to be born?", 
"Is there a seasonal pattern to births?"


6. birth_unix (int): Same date in Unix epoch format
### Testing purpose: Time representation conversion
Better questions needed
### Questions it enables: 
"Can the model convert between date formats?", 
"Can analysis be performed on numeric timestamp data?"

"What is the most common color?"
ANSWER: Blue (50% of all animals, due to our specified dominant distribution)

"Is there a relationship between color and animal type?"
ANSWER: Yes, strong correlation: fish are predominantly blue (80%), cats are predominantly red (80%), dogs are predominantly green (80%), birds are predominantly gray (80%), and turtles are predominantly mixed (80%)

### Testing purpose:
Categorical distribution analysis
Testing conditional statistics across groups
Testing pattern recognition between categorical variables
### Default pattern:
Strong but incomplete correlation with animal_type:
- Fish are predominantly blue (80%)
- Cats are predominantly red (80%)
- Dogs are predominantly green (80%)
- Birds are predominantly gray (80%)
- Turtles are predominantly mixed (80%)
- Remaining 20% randomly distributed among other colors
### Questions it enables:
- "What is the most common color?"
- "Is there a relationship between color and animal type?"
- "What percentage of red animals can swim?"
- "What is the average weight of blue animals compared to green ones?"
- "Which color has the highest average popularity score?"
- "Are there any animal types that never appear in certain colors?"
#### Why imbalanced data is useful:
- Tests frequency-based analysis: Model must recognize dominant colors in dataset
- Tests conditional probability: "If an animal is green, what's the probability it's a dog?"
- Enables complex filtering: Combinations like "blue fish that can fly" test multi-condition queries
- Tests model's data exploration: Can it identify the dominant color for each animal type?

### Sample Answer:
QUESTION: "What is the average weight of blue animals compared to green ones?"
ANSWER: Blue animals are heavier on average (predominantly fish at 20kg and some turtles at 50kg) compared to green animals (predominantly dogs at 10kg)
